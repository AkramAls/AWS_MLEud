# Operationalizing Machine Learning on SageMaker by Akram Al-Selwadi

## Initial Setup

I'm using the default SageMaker instance ml.t3.medium when Notebook Instances are created for my notebook as I will be only running the notebook only when working on the project, and I do not need a CPU or RAM more than that judging from the file size that is provided and the goals for the project.
